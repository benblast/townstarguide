        <h2>
          Step 1
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pick a spot with forest terrain close to a city.
        </p>
        <v-img

        <em class="img mb-3">Forest start</em>
        <p>
          The starting buildings are always the same:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Trade Depot
          </li>
          <li>
            Fuel Storage
          </li>
          <li>
            Silo
          </li>
          <li>
            Farm House
          </li>
          <li>
            Well
          </li>
          <li>
            Two Wheat Fields
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The starting items in your inventory are also always the same:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            40 Gasoline
          </li>
          <li>
            10 Wheat
          </li>
          <li>
            $25,000
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can see your current points in the top right corner, along with the time remaining for the round. Every round runs for 6 days, and your objective is to score points by selling the items you produce using the trade depot.
        </p>
        <p>
          In your top left, you see how much money you currently have. Beneath that is the wages your workers charge every minute in order to keep working, and then all the items you have in your inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, one of the easiest strategies to get a decent amount of money is to get windmills. Start by getting a Lumberjack, a Wood Shed and a Wind Mill.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Step 2
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sell 10 wheat and build a Storehouse.
        </p>

        <em class="img">Sell wheat, build Storehouse</em>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The Storehouse is needed to store the Flour we will be producing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be very conservative with your Gasoline in the beginning. You will run out much faster than you think. Therefore, it is important to make the most out of every tank of gas â€“ try only to sell higher value items like Flour, Sugar or Salt.
          For now, we will just sell the 10 Wheat to afford a Storehouse.
        </p>
       <h2>
         Step 3
       </h2>
        <p>
          Sell 10 Wheat and 3 Ponds on the bottom center of your map. <br>Then build a Lumberjack.
        </p>
        <v-img

        <em class="img">Step 3</em>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Ponds are the biggest strength of the Forest biome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selling a Pond gives you ${{ buildings.Pond.DestroyCost }}.
          We will use this to fund some of our early start, but be do not fall into the temptation to sell everything.
          They will be very useful to have later in your strategy.

        <h2>
          Step 4

        <p>
          Extend the Dirt Road in the top left and build 1 Windmill.

        <p class="mt-3">
          It's important to build the Windmill where it has {{ buildings.Windmill.ProximityDist }} tiles of free space around it.<br>
          If another building is closer than {{ buildings.Windmill.ProximityDist }} tiles from the Windmill, it will get <router-link to="/kbase/proximity">Wind Blocked</router-link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The production timer for Flour is as follows, with Green being no Wind Block at all:<br>
          Green {{ recipes.Flour.Time0 }}s<br>
          Yellow {{ recipes.Flour.Time1 }}s<br>
          Red {{ recipes.Flour.Time2 }}s

        </h1>
        <p>
          At this point you are free to play around and try different things by continuing to sell Flour for cash to build and grow.
          You might want to try adding another Farm House and more Wheat crops to increase Flour production.

          Important notes
        </h2>
        <p style="list-style: none">
            - If you get low on cash and you have enough gas you could sell 10 to help out, but I avoid that if possible.<br><br>

            - Now you just need to monitor your Energy, Water Drums, Crude Oil, Petroleum, and Gasoline to be sure you do not run out of storage space by over producing any of them.<br><br>

            - You can sell any extra products since you still have extra Gasoline, or you can turn off and back on any of the crafting to control how much of any item is made.<br><br>

            - Be sure to sell extra Water Drums or you will fill your Warehouse and have no place to store Energy and your Gasoline production will stop.<br><br>

            - Try to only sell Flour (or other high tier items) to save gas and maximize your money.
